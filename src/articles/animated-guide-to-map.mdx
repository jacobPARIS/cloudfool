This is an example of an animated guide to Array Map.

<AnimationMap />

This example shows a map callback that makes each item lowercase

<AnimationMapLowercase />

Probably the most common use of array map in React is to turn data into elements on the screen

This example shows a list of strings being mapped into HTML list items

<AnimationMapReactList />

The second argument to a map callback is the index of the item in the array

This example shows a list of strings being mapped into a numbered list

<AnimationMapReactListIndex />
